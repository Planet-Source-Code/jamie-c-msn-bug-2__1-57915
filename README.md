## Msn Bug 2\!


</div>

### Description

Hello, this is the coolest msn tweak ever made! You send it to the person and they open it.. It will run in the background of their computer quietely and every 20 seconds it will change their msn name to "I Am Gay", "I Am Homo!", "I got My Dad For Christmas!".. It is basically pointless but they think that there is a hacker in their computer! I use it on everyone and they get real scared :)... lol, use the code freely!
